---

A Flutter plugin for retrieving the device locale information.

## Installation

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```sh
dependencies:
  flutter_device_locale: <latest version>
```

Install packages from the command line (or from your editor):

```sh
flutter pub get
```

Import flutter_device_locale:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_device_locale/flutter_device_locale.dart';
```

## Usage

Retrieve the current locale:

```dart
Locale locale = await DeviceLocale.getCurrentLocale();
```

Retrieve the preferred locales:

```dart
List<Locale> preferredLocales = await DeviceLocale.getPreferredLocales();
```

### Note for Linux

Since GNU/Linux and POSIX doesn't provide a standard API for getting the preferred languages, `DeviceLocale.getPreferredLocales` always returns the current locale.
